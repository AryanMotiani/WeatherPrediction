# TODO for Model Updates

- [x] Add imports for StandardScaler and XGBoost
- [x] Update __init__ to include scaler and model choice (RF or XGBoost)
- [x] Modify preprocess_data to apply normalization to features
- [x] Update train_models to support both RF and XGBoost
- [x] Ensure predict_probabilities works with normalized features
- [x] Add user-driven features: allow custom feature selection and thresholds
- [x] Test the updated model with sample data
- [x] Add synthetic data generation for small datasets to improve generalization
- [x] Fix data splitting logic and method argument mismatches
- [x] Create comprehensive README.md with usage instructions and documentation
