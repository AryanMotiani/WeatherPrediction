# TODO for Thorough Testing and Fine-tuning of ClimateHealthRiskModel

- [x] Prepare diverse datasets for testing:
  - Real NASA POWER data
  - Synthetic NASA-like data
  - Edge cases with missing columns or unusual distributions
- [x] Implement unit tests for:
  - Data preprocessing and feature scaling
  - Target creation logic for all risk categories
  - Model training with both RandomForest and XGBoost (if available)
  - Probability prediction and health risk score calculation
- [x] Perform model evaluation on test sets:
  - Accuracy, F1 score, precision, recall for each risk model
  - Cross-validation consistency
- [x] Analyze model results in depth:
  - Investigate class distribution and balance in the dataset
  - Identify why some risks have zero F1, precision, recall
  - Check data units consistency (Celsius vs Fahrenheit)
  - Evaluate prediction probabilities and climatological means
- [x] Fine-tune model hyperparameters specifically for the datasets:
  - Adjust RandomForest and XGBoost parameters for best performance
  - Consider additional feature engineering if needed
- [ ] Test performance and scalability with larger datasets
- [ ] Validate synthetic data generation impact on model training and generalization
- [ ] Add error handling and logging for edge cases and data issues
- [ ] Document test results and fine-tuning outcomes

Next Steps:
- Fix data units inconsistency (change thresholds and synthetic data to Celsius)
- Re-run model training and evaluation
- Analyze class distributions and adjust sampling if needed
- Fine-tune hyperparameters for improved F1, precision, recall
- Test robustness on edge cases
